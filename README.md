## Brief Abstract
Arctic regions are warming, and this is anticpated to have [dramatic consequences](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/arctic-warming-locked-in-1.5056548) in Canada's high Arctic. Although Arctic temperatures are expected to increase over the next century, little is known about how microbial communities and their underlying metabolic processes will be affected by these environmental changes. To address this question, we adopted a space-for-time design to analyse sediments sampled from Lake Hazen, NU Canada. Situated on Ellesmere Island, Lake Hazen is the worldâ€™s largest high Arctic lake by volume. Despite being incredibly large it is not immune to [climate change](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/lake-hazen-arctic-one-degree-warming-1.4603809). In recent years enhanced glacial melt had resulted in increased annual runoff from surrounding glaciers to the watershed. We exploit the spatial heterogeneity created by varying runoff regimes, conducting metagenomic analyses of lake sediments along these spatial gradients to study how a transition from low to high runoff, used as a proxy for environmental change, affects microbial community structure and functional potential. This research presents evidence that increasing runoff leads to a decrease in taxonomic and functional diversity.
